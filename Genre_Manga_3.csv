Comedy,5693.0,Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood,0,https://images2.imgbox.com/80/a6/IumqbgDu_o.jpg,"Uplifting the audience with positive emotion takes priority, eliciting laughter, amusement, or general entertainment. Almost always, comedy stories are episodic or have happy endings."
Action,3607.0,Attack on Titan,0,https://images2.imgbox.com/60/81/ZxgM6985_o.jpg,"Exciting action sequences take priority and significant conflicts between characters are usually resolved with one's physical power.

Adventure,2790.0,Naruto,0,https://images2.imgbox.com/7c/63/wKXE5Jjv_o.jpg,"Whether aiming for a specific goal or just struggling to survive, the main character is thrust into unfamiliar situations or lands and continuously faces unexpected dangers. The narrative of adventure stories is always on how the characters react to sudden events or trials during the journey, indicating personal growth or setback based on which actions or choices are taken."
Kids,2489.0,Pokemon,1,https://images2.imgbox.com/ea/73/VnEZLovl_o.jpg,"These series are usually moralistic, often educating children about staying in the right path in life. Each chapter is usually a self-contained story."
Drama,2461.0,Tokyo Ghoul,0,https://images2.imgbox.com/dc/ac/kxXKjGjL_o.jpg,"Plot-driven stories focused on realistic characters experiencing human struggle. Because drama stories ask the question of what it means to be human, the conflict and emotions will be relatable, even if the settings or characters themselves are not. Here, you will see humanity at its worst, its best, and everything in between."
Sci-Fi,2445.0,One Punch Man,0,https://images2.imgbox.com/8c/da/Tja9Cc0c_o.jpg,"Imagined technological advancements or natural settings which are currently unreal in the present day but could be invented, caused, or explained by science in the future.

Slice of Life,1795.0,Toradora,0,https://images2.imgbox.com/0c/e5/BlTZx5Y6_o.jpg,"Slice of Life stories are focused on a seemingly random and mundane period of the main characters' lives. The absence of a central plot to carry the story towards a charted destination means Slice of Life stories frequently lack overarching conflict and resolution. While life is not without conflict and Slice of Life neither, here conflict appears and dissipates seemingly at will, without a specific narrative to enforce it."
Supernatural,1392.0,No Game No Life,0,https://images2.imgbox.com/83/9b/rGTiPxyj_o.jpg,"Primarily taking place on Earth, supernatural stories incorporate elements or attributes that are unnatural and unexplainable by science.

Military,533.0,Code Geass,0,https://images2.imgbox.com/bf/b7/5yjqRwZV_o.jpg,"In warfare, the ordinary becomes extraordinary as the ordinary gets replaced by violence and chaos.
